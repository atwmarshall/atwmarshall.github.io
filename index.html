                    I'm Archie Marshall, an AI Consultant & Engineer with a mechanical engineering background who specialises in bridging
                    the gap between AI, engineering, and business—delivering solutions that are practical, scalable, and effective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My AI journey began at Siemens Mobility in 2021, where I secured £25,000 in funding for an innovative computer vision
                    project to prevent train-related accidents. Leading a dynamic team, I delivered both physical and virtual demonstrations
                    to 30 colleagues, which led to my recognition as Inventor of the Year 2022 and four patent registrations. After
                    presenting to the UK Executive team, I secured £237,000 in additional funding, culminating in a successful 2023
                    prototype test at a heritage railway in collaboration with Southampton University's Institute of Sound and Vibration
                    Research—achieving Technology Readiness Level 5.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Seeking faster innovation cycles, I joined a software consultancy startup where I implemented process automation
                    solutions at Aston Martin and in my free-time contributed to open-source LLM projects. With a First-Class MEng in Mechanical Engineering
                    with Mechatronics, customer facing startup experience and management of multi-million-pound technical programs across international teams, I bring
                    both technical depth and business acumen to AI development. Currently, I'm working in stealth on a startup idea while
                    providing specialised consulting services.
