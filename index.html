                    I am Archie Marshall, AI Consultant & Engineer. With a background in mechanical engineering and experience across a wide
                    range of industries, I specialize in bridging the gap between AI, engineering, and businessâ€”delivering solutions that actually work.

                <p>
                    My journey into AI started while working at a software consultancy startup, where I've been automating business
                    processes at Aston Martin and contributing to open-source LLM projects. I love tackling real business problems with
                    practical AI solutions, finding that sweet spot between cutting-edge technology and enterprise needs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Before my AI focus, I led an 18-person R&D team at Siemens Mobility, to deliver a tooling programme for next-generation European Train Control
                    System technology. My work in computer vision and railway safety systems earned me Inventor of the Year 2022 and
                    resulted in four patents. This experience taught me how to build reliable, scalable systems that businesses can
                    actually trust and use.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With a First Class MEng in Mechanical Engineering with Mechatronics and experience managing multi-million pound
                    technical programs across international teams, I bring both technical depth and practical business sense to AI
                    development. I'm now working in stealth on a startup idea while providing specialized consulting services.
