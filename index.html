                    I’m Archie Marshall, an AI Consultant & Engineer with a background in mechanical engineering and experience spanning
                    multiple industries. I specialize in bridging the gap between AI, engineering, and business—delivering solutions that
                    are practical, scalable, and effective.

                <p>
                    My journey into AI began at a software consultancy startup, where I automated business processes at Aston Martin and
                    contributed to open-source LLM projects. I thrive on solving real business challenges with AI, finding the sweet spot
                    between cutting-edge technology and enterprise needs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Before shifting to AI, I led an 18-person R&D team at Siemens Mobility, developing tooling programs for next-generation
                    European Train Control Systems. My work in computer vision and railway safety systems earned me Inventor of the Year
                    2022 and resulted in four patents. This experience shaped my approach to building AI solutions—focusing on reliability,
                    scalability, and real-world impact.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With a First-Class MEng in Mechanical Engineering with Mechatronics and experience managing multi-million-pound
                    technical programs across international teams, I bring both technical depth and business acumen to AI development.
                    Currently, I’m working in stealth on a startup idea while providing specialized consulting services.
